# Friendsr
## Unit 3 from course Native App Studio

This app is a social media app in which multiple friends appear. It is possible to give all these friends a rating based on their
profile. To do this, one must click on a profile in the grid view to enter a profile page. On this profile page is a ratings bar, which
can be used to rate the profile. 
The app works in both landscape and portrait mode.
